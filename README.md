# 3rd Year Project Expansion

**This project is a work in progress.** 

Whilst my *[3rd year project](https://github.com/AlexPBarlaam/Y3-Project_Code)* was a success, there was a few shortcomings that were highlighted in my dissertation and functionalities that could not be achieved. This project aims to be a follow-up to and improve upon the algorithm and add additional functionalities. This includes storing the railway data inside a database instead of hardcoding it into the classes instances, simplifying the algorithm, as well as adding signalling, the latter not being added into the original project. One further omission is also the lack of a GUI which would have looked nice despite the project not being intended for the general public. This will also be addressed.
